------Skill Swap Platform — Mini Web Application------

---> In today’s fast-paced world, people are constantly looking to learn new skills, but often lack the resources or money to do so. At the same time, many individuals possess valuable skills they are willing to share. Our proposed solution — Skill Swap Platform — is a mini web application that enables users to list the skills they offer and request the skills they want in return.

The platform encourages collaborative learning by allowing users to connect, communicate, and swap skills in a fair and transparent way. It promotes peer-to-peer learning, and is designed with ease of use, privacy control, and community safety in mind.



# Features Summary :-
